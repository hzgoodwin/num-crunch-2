# Project title: Against the Spread

# Purpose:
Against the Spread is a tool for bettors to make better-informed bets on NFL games. Our app has two primary functionalities. First, it allow users to see what the actual spread was for games with characteristics selected and filtered by the user. This includes graphical analysis. Second, it allows users to predict what the actual spread will be for a game using a statistical model that uses user-selected input variables. A more comprehensive overview of the app can be found in the app's Main tab.
