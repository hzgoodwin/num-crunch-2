  "<p>This app gives users the ability to filter NFL games starting from the 2021 season to help inform a decision on what team to bet on. 2024 season data is current through 12/5/24. A couple things to know before getting into our app:</p>",
  "<h4>Sports Gambling 101:</h4>
    <p><b>What is point spread?</b> The point spread is the expected final score difference between two teams. It is represented as both a negative and positive number; if the spread is 3 points, you'll see that as both -3 and +3. The team that is the favorite to win gets the minus-number (-3); the underdog gets the plus-number (+3). (via Fox Sports)</p>
    
    <p><b>What is over/under?</b> The expected combined points scored by both teams in a game, also known as the total. When high-powered football teams like the Bills and Chiefs play, the over/under could be as high as 55. When it’s the Dolphins and Jaguars, it could be 38.5. <b>Over</b> bets need to surpass the total while <b>Under</b> bets must stay lower. (via Fox Sports)</p>",

  "<p>To begin, select the “Game Results” tab in the above menu bar. Once selected, you will be greeted with a page divided in half. On the left side is a column with several variables and filters that can be edited, and on the right is a one-character-based and two-graphic-based output result. Let’s go through each variable and filter in the left-side column:</p>",
  
  "<ul>
          <li><b>Select Home Team & Select Away Team:</b> This filter allows the user to select their home of choice and their away team of choice. This filter can be used to view a team’s entire history of games at home or away if only one filter is used. Example: Every home game the Seahawks have played since 2021. This filter can also be used to see every matchup between two teams. Example: Every game the Seahawks have been the home team and the 49ers have been the away team.</li>
          <li><b>Home Team Spread:</b> This filter allows the user to give a range of searchable odds (-20 to 20) for the home team. Example: Every game where the home team is favored by between -5 and -10.</li>
          <li><b>Home and Away Team Winning Percentage:</b> These filters allow the user to select games played where the home or away team has a specific winning percentage. Example: Every game where the home team has a winning percentage of between .67 and 1. This filter can also be combined for home and away teams. Example: Every game played where the home team has a winning percentage of between .67 and 1 and the away team has a winning percentage of between 0 and .5.</li>
          <li><b>Season:</b> This variable allows the user to select one, multiple, or all seasons of which to pull games from. Example: Every game played in 2022 and 2023.</li>
          <li><b>Week of Season:</b> This variable allows the user to select a range of weeks or a single week where games were played. Example: Every game played between weeks 14 and 17.</li>
          <li><b>Day of Week:</b> This allows the user to select which day(s) of the week a game is played on. It also allows the user to exclude certain days. Example: Only show games played on Thursdays.</li>
          <li><b>Game Time:</b> This filter allows the user to select the time of day the game was played. Example: Every game played at night or every game played in the afternoon and night.</li>
          <li><b>Divisional Games Only:</b> This variable allows the user to toggle games where the home team is only playing other teams in their division. Example: Games where the Seahawks are the home team and are only playing teams in the NFC West.</li>
          <li><b>Home Team off Bye / Away Team off Bye:</b> This variable allows the user to toggle whether a team is coming off a bye week or not.</li>
          <li><b>Over/Under:</b> This filter allows the user to find games that had a certain level of predicted scoring. Example: Games where the over/under was between 40 and 50 points.</li>
          <li><b>Temperature:</b> This filter allows the user to select a range of temperatures and find games played within that range. Example: Every game played where the temperature was between 32- and 45-degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        </ul>",
  
  "<p>These variables can be used on their own, but the power of this app is their use in combination to make a unique query for a game you are interested in betting on. For example, if you are interested in betting on Rams vs 49ers on Thursday, December 11th, 2024, you can search for similar games by inputting a home team spread of between -5 and 0, Thursday games only, at night, and divisional games only. You would find that 8 games meet similar criteria, and 62.5% of the time, the home team covered the spread.</p>"
